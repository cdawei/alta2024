#### LLMs: what they are and where they are heading
Generative AI has unleashed hype and concern. But it is surprising how few people understand how simple it is at heart, and how some of its shortcomings spring from its essential nature and will remain hard to overcome. In this talk I briefly describe the essential process and explore the three principal directions of GenLLM research: making them usable, useful, and understandable.

#### LLM Evaluation: Writing Styles, Role-playing, and Visual Comprehension 
Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities that extend beyond language understanding and generation. This underscores the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs that covers a broader spectrum of capabilities beyond traditional NLP tasks. In this talk, I will share some of our recent work on LLM evaluation, with a focus on LLMs' writing styles and role-playing capabilities, and the abilities of large vision-language models to combine and interpret visual and linguistic signals in complex scenarios. 

### Steven Bird - Charles Darwin University

### Kyla Quinn - Australian Department of Defence
