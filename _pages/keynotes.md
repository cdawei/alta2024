Generative AI has unleashed hype and concern. But it is surprising how few people understand how simple it is at heart, and how some of its shortcomings spring from its essential nature and will remain hard to overcome. In this talk I briefly describe the essential process and explore the three principal directions of GenLLM research: making them usable, useful, and understandable.
